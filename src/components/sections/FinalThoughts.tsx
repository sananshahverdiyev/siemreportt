          <p>
            Regardless of which platform you select, we recommend the following implementation approach:
          </p>
          
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Start with a pilot deployment</strong> - Begin with a subset of critical log sources before
              expanding to the full environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Develop use cases iteratively</strong> - Focus on implementing a few high-value detection use
              cases first, then expand.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Plan for growth</strong> - Design your architecture to accommodate at least 2x your current log
              volume to prevent frequent redesigns.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Document thoroughly</strong> - Create comprehensive documentation for your configuration and
              customizations to ensure knowledge transfer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Allocate sufficient resources</strong> - Budget not just for the platform but also for training,
              professional services, and ongoing optimization.
            </li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Long-term Considerations</h3>
          
          <p>
            SIEM solutions are long-term investments, often with 3-5 year lifecycles before major reconsideration.
            Factor in the following long-term considerations:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Vendor roadmap alignment</strong> - Ensure the vendor's development priorities align with your
              future security needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Skills availability</strong> - Consider the availability of talent for your chosen platform in
              your hiring market.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exit strategy</strong> - Plan for how you would migrate to a different solution if needed in
              the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compliance evolution</strong> - Evaluate how well the platform can adapt to changing compliance
              requirements.
            </li>
          </ul>
